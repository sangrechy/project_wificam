# üì∑ WiFiCam ‚Äì Mobile Camera Streaming over Wi-Fi

**WiFiCam** is a simple web app that enables real-time video streaming from a mobile device to another device using WebRTC and Socket.IO. It is ideal for LAN-based peer-to-peer streaming or remote viewing via Ngrok tunneling.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sangrechy/project_wificam.git
cd project_wificam/app
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install express socket.io
```

> `path`, `fs`, `os` are built-in Node.js modules and **do not need to be installed**

## üìÅ Folder Structure

```txt
project_wificam/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /app
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js              # Express + Socket.IO signaling server
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /public
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mobile.html        # Camera streaming client (mobile side)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ viewer.html        # Viewer client (to watch the stream)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure `mobile.html` and `viewer.html` are located inside the `/public` directory.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Server

```bash
node server.js
```

You‚Äôll see something like:

```txt
Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

Open in your browser:

* On mobile device: `http://<your-local-ip>:3000/mobile.html`
* On viewer device: `http://<your-local-ip>:3000/viewer.html`

> üí° Use your LAN IP (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) ‚Äî **not `localhost`** ‚Äî to connect across devices.

---

## üåê Access from Outside Network (via Ngrok)

Sometimes devices on different networks or mobile browsers cannot access your local IP directly. Use Ngrok to tunnel your server publicly:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Ngrok will give you a public HTTPS URL like:

```
https://abcd-1234.ngrok.io
```

Use these links:

* Mobile device: `https://abcd-1234.ngrok.io/mobile.html`
* Viewer device: `https://abcd-1234.ngrok.io/viewer.html`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure **both devices use the Ngrok link**, not local IP, in this mode.

---

## üîê Security Notes

* This is a demo app intended for LAN streaming
* In production:

  * Use HTTPS + Secure WebSocket (WSS)
  * Restrict access with authentication
  * Add logging and rate-limiting as needed
